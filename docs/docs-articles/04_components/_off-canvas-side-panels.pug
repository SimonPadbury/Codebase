    p In this simple example, no width has been specified &ndash; so it will expand to the width required for its content (i.e. the text you are currently reading), up to max-width 100%.

  p You will need to specify whether the content of the off-canvas side panel is to slide in from the left or right &ndash; and you must also position its respective controller on the same side as what the content will slide in from).
  
  p You will also need to add an off-canvas control (navicon) for toggling the side panel. Be sure to set the off-canvas control #[code code data-control_id=""] to point to its respective off-canvas content #[code id=""].
  
  p It is possible to have more than one off-canvas side panel component. But only one can be activated at any one time.

  h3 Controlling the Off-Canvas Content Width
  
  p The off-canvas content block will "stretch to fit" the width of whatever content you put inside it (up to 100% width).

  p You can also control the off-canvas content block width in your own stylesheet.

  p.bg--green-lighten-3.p--16 #[b Note:] The #[code .off-canvas__content] slides off-canvas to a width of #[span.bolder 110%] of the content width. The extra 10% ensures that a box-shadow on the content will also be hidden off-canvas.
    
  p The following demos operate as off-canvas sidebars at all viewport widths:

  .b--heavy.b--rounded.b--gray-lighten-2.p--16
    
    .off-canvas__ctrl(data-content-id="oc-ex-2").
      #[i(data-feather="menu" aria-hidden="true")]
    .off-canvas__content.off-canvas__content--left.bg--red-lighten-2.p--16.bs--3z#oc-ex-2
      .off-canvas__close.off-canvas__close--right.
        #[i(data-feather="x-square" aria-hidden="true")]
      | Example 2: off-canvas side panel content
    | Example 2: this off-canvas side panel is only as wide as its content requires.

  h3.mt--line Deactivating an Off-Canvas Component Above a Media Query Viewport Width

  p Sometimes you may require some content to be displayed using an off-canvas side panel for smaller viewports but that switches to being an on-canvas side panel for wider viewports. This is done by adding modifier classes (and by hiding the controls on wider viewports), as in the following table:
    
  table.table.table--rows.table--columns
    thead
      tr
        th Off-canvas content
        th Off-canvas control
        th Off-canvas close
    tbody
      tr
        td #[code .off-canvas__content]
        td(colspan="2") (Off-canvas side panel operates at all viewport widths &ndash; so you won't want to hide the controls.)
      tr
        td #[code.nowrap .off-canvas__content--sm]
        td #[code.nowrap .hide--md-up]
        td #[code.nowrap .show--md-up]
      tr
        td #[code .off-canvas__content--md]
        td #[code .hide--lg-up]
        td #[code .hide--lg-up]

  p (There is no #[code .off-canvas__content--lg] &ndash; that would operate the same as for an unspecified media query width.)
  
  .off-canvas__ctrl.hide--md-up(data-content-id="oc-ex-5").
    #[i(data-feather="menu" aria-hidden="true")] &nbsp; #[i(data-feather="arrow-left")] Example 5: Tap or click the icon to the left

  .off-canvas__content.off-canvas__content--sm.off-canvas__content--left.p--24.bg--blue.white#oc-ex-5
    .off-canvas__close.off-canvas__close--right.
      #[i.hide--md-up(data-feather="x-square" aria-hidden="true")]
    h3 Example 5
    
    p.lead This colored panel operates as an off-canvas side panel at small viewport widths, but it is on-canvas (as a simple DIV within this article) for medium viewports up.
    p.hide--md-up In this simple example, no width has been specified for the off-canvas panel &ndash; so it will expand to the width required for its content (i.e. the text you are currently reading), up to max-width 100%. 


  p.mt--line You will also need to add the appropriate class to hide the controller and the closer above the same viewport width.
